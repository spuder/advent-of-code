Is it worth making an object for this? 


What operations are required?
- Split code into blocks 4 bytes long unless its a 99
- Look at index0, if 0,1,2 or 99 do approprate action
- optcode 1 add together (method)
- optcode 2 multiply together (method)
- Increment 4 bytes

Should I pass by reference, or pass by value?
